        <p class="history-p">The history of computer progress is a great human and technological story that took centuries. This started with ancient people like Babylonians and Egyptians who thought up computing devices, for example, calculating tools such as abacus and Antikythera mechanism. These primitive gadgets were then developed into more advanced computational tools; notable among these was Charles Babbage’s mechanical calculators like the Difference Engine and Analytical Engine that introduced concepts of programmability, stored memory and others.
            The 20th century witnessed some remarkable breakthroughs which marked the modern age of computing. The Second World War saw the invention of electronic computers such as Colossus and ENIAC that provided fast computations for military purposes and scientific research. With the war over, Bell Labs researchers discovered transistor technology in the 1950s leading to an era characterized by miniaturization as well as efficiency hence making it essential in creating smaller, faster and more reliable computers.The 1970s saw the personal computer revolution,
             with the introduction of devices such as the Altair 8800 and the Apple I, which enabled individuals and small businesses to work on computers for the first time. They played a major role in the formation of the future of computers and then the development of integrated circuit technology which is one of the decades, the development of machines and internets in computing power, a power deskot, laptopphonas, . others, Digital devices that expand inevitably Built in modern life. Today, the relentless progress continues with advances in areas such as quantum computing,
              artificial intelligence and edge computing, which promise to redefine the boundaries of what’s possible in computing
