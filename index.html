            <img src="images/Mauvais-cable-management-PC.webp" alt="poorly cable managed PC" height="350px">
            <p>Cable management is an importent part to building your custom PC but not nessasary. If you care at all
                what
                you want your PC to look like, your going to want to succesfully cable manage your build.
                The first thing you can do to have good cable management is choosing a PC case that is advanced enough
                to
                slots and paths for your cords to follow.
                When it comes down to it, if managing your cables seems to complicated then dont worry about it. It
                could
                slightly impede airflow and look ugly but your computer will still work either way.

            <h2>3. Install Parts Carfully</h2>
            <img src="images/how_to_install_a_processor_into_a_motherboard_4fQ4w2mURA.avif"
                alt="carfully installing a cpu" height="350px">
            <p>Most of the components on a computer are fragil and expensive. It is important to install your components
                without to much force or you could risk breaking something.
                The components like the RAM, CPU, and GPU, all have slots on the motherboard that they will slip into
                but if you are having trouble installing one of these parts
                instead of pressing harder try watching a tutorial on how to install that specific part because its
                always better safe than sorry.
            </p>
            <p> The best way to ensure the sucess of building your own PC is to take as much time as possible. from
                start to complete it can take up to three or four hours for a beginner.</p>

            <h2>4. Manage ESD (Electrostatic-Discharge) </h2>
            <img src="images/Electrostatic-Discharge-image.jpg" alt="Electrostatic Discharge image" height="350px"
                width="400px">
            <p>electrostatic discharge is basically static electricity that can result in damage to the sensetive
                electronic components, including PCs. The damage occurs when the components,
                such as microprocessors, that are designed to opperate with a sepcific voltage range gets a spike of
                electricity. This damage is irreversable.
                The damage can weaken components and gradually degrading their preformance therefore shortening the
                lifespan.
            </p>
            <h3>Ways to prevent this are:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work on a hard suface.</li>
                <li>Dont use static-friendly clothing.</li>
                <li>touch grounded metal objects every couple of mintues.</li>
                <li>Avoide standing on carpet</li>
