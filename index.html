        <h2 id="secondtip">2. Cable Management</h2>
        <img src="images/Mauvais-cable-management-PC.webp" alt="poorly cable managed PC" height="350px">
        <p>Cable management is an importent part to building your custom PC but not nessasary. If you care at all what
            you want your PC to look like, your going to want to succesfully cable manage your build.
            The first thing you can do to have good cable management is choosing a PC case that is advanced enough to
            slots and paths for your cords to follow.
            When it comes down to it, if managing your cables seems to complicated then dont worry about it. It could
            slightly impede airflow and look ugly but your computer will still work either way.
